# **Bubbly Quest - UI Implementation Plan**

* **Project:** Bubbly Quest UI
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Date:** October 17, 2025
* **Author:** Claude

## **Overview**

This document outlines the complete UI implementation plan for Bubbly Quest, a desktop text-based adventure game frontend that integrates with the external C.H.A.R.G.E. game engine. The UI follows a playful, toy-like aesthetic with heavily rounded corners, micro-animations, and a delightful user experience.
