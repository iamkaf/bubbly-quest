  🔧 Implementation Intentions & Architecture Decisions

  JavaScript-First Architecture

  All game logic lives in TypeScript/JavaScript. Rust backend is minimal - only file I/O via Tauri FS plugin. No        
  custom Rust commands.

  State Management Strategy

  - Zustand chosen for simplicity and minimal boilerplate
  - Immer middleware for Game Store (complex nested updates)
  - Persist middleware for UI Store (theme preference)
  - No middleware for Adventure Store (large data, file-backed)

  File System Strategy

  - Use Tauri FS plugin directly (no custom Rust)
  - BaseDirectory.AppData for secure, scoped access
  - Result-based error handling (FileSystemResult<T>)
  - Zod validation on all read operations
  - Detailed error logging with validation.error.format()

  Validation Strategy

  - Zod schemas mirror TypeScript interfaces
  - Runtime validation prevents corrupted data
  - Safe validation (safeParse) returns { success, data?, error? }
  - String keys in z.record() for JSON compatibility

  Data Organization

  - Single adventure.json file per adventure (not split rooms/items/monsters)
  - Metadata in separate index.json for quick listing
  - Saves stored per-adventure in saves/ subdirectory
  - Template directory for future use

  Theme System

  - CSS Custom Properties on data-theme attribute
  - 10+ themes planned (8 complete)
  - Instant theme switching without reload
  - Theme preference persisted in localStorage

  Command Parser (Planned - Phase 4)

  - Natural language processing with synonyms
  - Context-aware (knows current room, visible items/monsters)
  - Compound command support
  - Flexible input matching (regex + fuzzy)

  Game Engine (Planned - Phase 5)

  - Stateless command processor (pure functions)
  - State mutations only through Zustand actions
  - Room descriptions cached for performance
  - Undo/redo via command history replay

  - TypeScript compilation (npx tsc --noEmit)
  - ESLint (npm run lint)
  - Prettier formatting (npm run format)
  - Rust compilation (cargo check)
  - Full test suite (npm run check)

  ✅ All commits have detailed messages with:
  - Feature description
  - File changes listed
  - Implementation details
  - Co-authored with Claude

  🎯 Next Steps (When Resuming)

  1. Immediate: Verify app works in Tauri dev mode
    - Run npm run tauri dev
    - Verify starter adventure is created on first run
    - Check console for initialization messages
    - Test theme switching
  2. Begin Phase 4: Command Parser System
    - Create src/utils/commandParser.ts
    - Create src/types/commands.ts
    - Implement basic command recognition
    - Add synonym support
    - Write unit tests
  3. Technical Debt: None currently
  4. Documentation: All up to date
